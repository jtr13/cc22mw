## Motivation & Explanation

My orig inal motivation for this project was to brainstorm viables activities that people could partake in to reignite their creative spark while creating data visualizations. By culture, I am a storyteller—and I have always viewed data visualizations as a prime, modern way of storytelling. By trade, I am a content creator. I specialize in editing videos and creating graphics that not only convey a story, but that inspire people to do something great with their lives. Naturally, when I visualize data, I try to incorporate both the artistic and cultural aspects of my training. I strive to make accessible visualizations that are also fun, engaging, and intentional; however, I have been in many spaces with data scientists that do not prioritize such creativity. Although I understand the importance of practicality and “professionalism”, I strongly believe that having a creative mindset is a major strength. As a result, I created a video in which I explain three activities that can aid in one’s journey to making more creative visualizations.<br />
<br />
Originally, I wanted to make a video in the form of a Tik Tok. My hope was to share it on the platform to make this information more accessible to the community who needs it and boost its impact. However, I found myself with over 20 minutes of content that I had to cut down, edit, and piece together. Ultimately, I was left with my final 6 minute video—which is too long to post on Tik Tok. If I did have to re-do this project, I would have done a shorter video; in turn, this would have enabled me to post it. To compensate for the missing information and explanations, I would pair said video with a blog post that goes into further detail about each activity. Other than that, I feel like the video came out pretty well and I am proud of the final products.
